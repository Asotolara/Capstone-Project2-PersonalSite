                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p> I was born in the US but was initially
                    raised in Mexico before my family moved back to
                    the US during my youth. I am the second youngest
                    out of my other 5 siblings. I enjoy doing various
                    hobbies such as exercising, going out, playing video games,
                    and learning new things in regards to technology.
